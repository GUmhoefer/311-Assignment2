Readme for OleloTree, OleloNode, and OleloDriver. 
Author: Gregor Umhoefer

Running the driver class brings up a menu of options for the OleloTree database. It inserts multiple nodes that contain phrases from the ʻOlelo noʻeau,
along with their translations in English, a description of their meaning in ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi, and a description in English, for a total of four fields.
These phrases are alphabetised by the original ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi phrase. More phrases can be inserted.

* Note that the ʻokina character ʻ comes last in the alphabet, so phrases that begin with this character will be at the end of the database.

The menu only takes numerical input, and has the 10 following options:
  1. Check if a phrase in ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi is in the database.
  2. Return the phrase that is first in alphabetical order.
  3. Return the phrase that is last in alphabetical order.
  4. Enter a phrase in ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi to return its alphabetical predecessor.
  5. Enter a phrase in ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi to return its alphabetical successor.
  6. Insert a phrase into the database.
  7. Me Hua: Enter a word in ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi and return all of the phrases that contain that word.   
  8. With Word: Enter a word in English and return all of the phrases whose translations contain that word.
  9. Print all of the phrases in alphabetical order.
  0. Exit the program.

* For some reason the 0. option displays as 10. in the readme.
